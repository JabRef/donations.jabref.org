# Page redirection

This page redirects to the current donations page of JabRef.

The implementation follows a [tutorial by W3C](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-redirect-a-web-page-in-html.html).

We use a YAML front matter to prevent the issue that this file is rendered as `index.html` in the Jekyll conversion process.
